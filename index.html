You certainly have heard or tried the concept of home sharing and specifically the application of Airbnb, which gives you a good and unique accommodation , that gives you a authentic travel experience. to being closer to the culture of the place you visit by living experiences with local population, as well as the chance to enjoy with so varied range price in homestay of the place you are visiting comparison with hotels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And when we talk about travel is definitely coming to first thoughts the two important things are accommodation and budget.</p><p>In this post, I will describe what Seattle Airbnb home-sharing price rates are? What seasons are occurring in Seattle? How many listings are in Seattle neighborhoods with price rates? And What are the important factors that are affect accommodation prices in Seattle?</p><p>We used Seattle Airbnb Open Data to find answers to these questions, This data is describing the listing activity of home sharing in Seattle, for 3818 accommodation in 365 days of 2016 and a few days of 2017.</p><p>My suggestion would be to use data suggest to help you work out on this information to choose which the best time and neighborhoods in your search for Seattle accommodation in Airbnb.</p><p>Let’s get into the stats then!</p><p><br></p><p><b></b></p><h2>Part I: Seattle – the best time to visit</h2><p>When I was thinking about how to answer this question the most data come to my mind was calendar data listings with the price for 365 days, that describe for 3818 accommodations in Seattle with their prices in whole the year.</p><p>Through my research in Seattle data I found some information that I would like to share with you to help you a bit in understanding the best time to visit Seattle:</p><ol><li>There are two weekly patterns in Seattle housing rates, one is have a normal price in weekdays and the second is often increased more in weekend.<br></li><li>Average of Seattle houses price is on rising over the time.<br></li><li>The average of price of housing in Seattle is reaching highest rate in July.<br></li><li>The peak season in Seattle is (June, July, August).<br></li></ol><p>We can see in the following figure average monthly house prices in Seattle.</p><figure data-orig-width="981" data-orig-height="464" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/287b6aad44e48a74272d52c569ea8f2c/tumblr_inline_pf575bHelp1wn0yfd_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="981" data-orig-height="464"></figure><p><b></b></p><h2>Part II: Seattle – the neighborhoods</h2><p>In the chart below, I was interested more about neighborhoods and their rate price compared to their number of houses in neighborhoods. The blue bars represent a comparison of lowest 10 neighborhoods price rate in Seattle which is between 70 and 80 dollars and the orange bars present a comparison of lowest 10 neighborhoods price rate as how many of houses in the neighborhoods which is 10 to 45 houses in neighborhoods.</p><figure data-orig-width="962" data-orig-height="451" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/e1521efd3e20c72635d51490f1c283bc/tumblr_inline_pf575sXrF91wn0yfd_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="962" data-orig-height="451"></figure><ol><li>We found the lowest rate of neighborhoods are (Rainier Beach , Olympic Hills , South Delridge) and all of them are less than 20 houses in each neighborhoods.<br></li><li>We found the highest rate of neighborhoods are (Pioneer Square, Central Business District, Fauntleroy, Belltown) too many houses in these neighborhoods as Belltown alone have more than 200 houses .<br></li><li>Higher rates of these neighborhoods is between $150 to $170.<br></li></ol><p><br></p><p><b></b></p><h2>Part III: Seattle – factors affect in accommodation prices</h2><p>Finally, I wondered if there might be a factors that affect accommodation prices in Seattle so I have built a model that can help us in predict the accommodation prices in Seattle based on Airbnb data of 3818 listings , we have used all the features of homes and we found the most impressive factor that affect in the price is numbers of rooms which can alone capture more than 35% of the price information.</p><p>The predictive model is not good enough since is accuracy up to 60%.</p><figure data-orig-width="963" data-orig-height="439" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/93a6fa5dc8a79e695f70275a1a971253/tumblr_inline_pf576c9jji1wn0yfd_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="963" data-orig-height="439"></figure><p>As shown above, we can see that the price is greatly affected by numbers of rooms. With slight effect of the following factors (bathrooms, accommodates, reviews, and room type).</p><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><p>In this article, we took a look at how homes in Seattle perform according to Airbnb open data.</p><ol><li>We found that in Seattle, room rates are increasing over time and increased more in weekend, and the peak season in (June, July, and August) the accommodation reach to highest prices.<br></li><li>We looked at the neighborhoods with lowest average price which are suitable for those with a limited budget but there a shortage in houses in those neighborhoods and in for neighborhoods with highest average prices they are widely available.<br></li><li>We found the most affected factors to the price is numbers of rooms, with slight effect other factors.<br></li></ol><p>The findings here are observational, not the result of a formal study and we have done by using a small dataset.</p><p>To see more about this analysis, see the link to my <a href="https://github.com/Jaghwani/Seattle-Airbnb-Open-Data">Github </a>available here.</p>
